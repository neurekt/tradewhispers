    "# Baseline Experiment - Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "## Model: FinBERT PT-BR\n",
    "- Current Issue: How to compute exchange rate forward returns if news is released on weekends and usd/brl isn't being traded? There's no matching exchange rate unless we use Friday's closing and Monday's opening to measure the change.\n",
    "- Hypothesis (h1a): Sentiment outputs, mapped to direction, can predict short-term exchange rate movements.\n",
    "- Objective: A baseline comparison before testing hyped-up LLMs capabilities\n",
    "- Value Proposition: This is the first known study to be conducted on applying language models to trade in emerging currency markets. Especially in a multilingual context.\n",
    "- Why sentiment analysis as baseline: \n",
    "    - FinBERT is widely cited in financial NLP literature\n",
    "    - outperforms general BERT and lexicon-based models on tasks like financial sentiment classification\n",
    "    - Traditional ML methods rely on sparse inputs or static word embeddings (like Word2Vec) which don't capture context\n",
    "    - sentiment analysis is commonly used in generating trading signals, however I believe that market does not operate\n",
    "    on whether a piece of text is happy or sad. Thus, I'm expecting the following experiments to outperform this baseline. \n",
    "    I just want to rule sentiment analysis out of the picture. \"Predicting directional movement\" is a better approach.\n",
    "    - it was used as a benchmark in very similar paper found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mlwa.2023.100508\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent Variable (Predictor):\n",
    "    - Text: headline / article content\n",
    "    - Category: FinBERT sentiment output\n",
    "    - Binary Label: heuristic mapping (positive -> 1, negative -> -1) (bullish or bearish in commercial terms)\n",
    "    - (POSSIBLY CONSIDER as a control var/experiment?): Multi-class Label: neutral (0) label defined by threshold label (min exchange rate % change)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependent Variable (Ground Truth):\n",
    "    - Directional Movement: binary direction of exchange rate following news timestamp (time frame TBD)\n",
    "    - (POSSIBLY CONSIDER?): percent change in exchange rate over defined window? Measures profitability...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset Creation Process:\n",
    "    - News Data: There are only 3,519 headlines before **Timestamp[2024-12-30 17:38:00]**, which is the latest possible timestamp for a t+20 analysis (since exchange rate data ends at 17:58:00). In total, the dataset contains 4630 headlines. These cannot be used until exchange rates are available on a minute-level basis for December 30, 2024, to January 15, 2025. \n",
    "        - Dataset Creation Process: Bom Dia Mercado (BDM) → Eli formatted news data into excel file → preprocess.ipynb → export to repo → final dataset\n",
    "    - FX Rate Data: Minute-level time series of USD/BRL exchange rates, synchronized with news timestamps in pandas ISO datetime object format.\n",
    "        - Dataset Creation Process: Bloomberg → retrieve USD/BRL exchange rates as excel file → preprocess.ipynb → export to repo → final dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "    - Dataset used in this experiment: experimental_dataset.csv with 3519 news headlines \n",
    "    - USING HEADLINES ONLY not ARTICLE CONTENT and COMMENTS as past research has shown that these are not useful for prediction purposes, and they are noisy.\n",
    "    - straightforward t+1 to t+20 prediction horizon by computing directional movement using following exchange rate minus exchange rate at t for each increment"
